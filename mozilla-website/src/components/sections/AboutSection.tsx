          The Mozilla project was founded in San Francisco in 1998, when the
          Netscape browser made the radical decision to give away its program
          code to the public to build on and improve. At that time, one company
          had a virtual monopoly on how people experienced the internet.

          Eventually, the open-source Mozilla project morphed into the wildly
          popular first version of Firefox.

          Today, Mozilla continues its movement toward a better internet with
          millions of active community members spanning the globe, advocating
          for ethical tech, trustworthy AI and producing privacy-first products
          that give more power to the people.
